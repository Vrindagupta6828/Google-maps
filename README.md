# Google-maps
I made an interface similar to google maps which shows the direction between two places thus,giving the shortest path.

This is my data structure project which is from an e-learning website in java.I have not implemented the code from scratch but have written the functions in there.

The project include concepts of graphs and their traversal of which data structure is better and much more.My code is in the src file.
